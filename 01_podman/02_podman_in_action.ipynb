    "The Linux kernel employs a concept called **namespaces**, which creates virtualized environments, where one set of processes sees one set of resources, while another set of processes sees a different set of resources. These **virtualized environments** eliminate processes’ views into the rest of the system, giving them the feel of a virtual machine (VM) without the overhead. Examples of namespaces include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network namespace** — Eliminates the access to the host network but gives access to virtual network devices,\n",
    "- **Mount namespace** — Eliminates the view of all the filesystem, except the containers filesystem,\n",
    "- **PID namespace** — Eliminates the view of other processes on the system; container processes only see the processes within the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "These container technologies have existed in the Linux kernel for many years. Security tools for isolating processes started in Unix back in the 1970s, and SELinux started in 2001. Namespaces were introduced around 2004, and cgroups were introduced around 2006."

    "Systemd is the fundamental init system in the operating systems. The init process on a Linux system is the first process that is started by the kernel on boot. Therefore, the init system is the ancestor of all processes and can monitor them all. Podman wants to fully integrate the running of containers with the init system. Users want to use systemd to start and stop containers at boot time. Containers should do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support systemd within a container,\n",
    "- Support socket activation,\n",
    "- Support systemd notifications that a containerized application is fully activated,\n",
    "- Allow systemd to fully manage the cgroups and lifespan of a containerized application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, containers work as services in systemd unit files. Many developers want to run systemd within a container to run multiple system-defined services within a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the upstream Docker community disagrees with this and has denied all pull requests that attempt to integrate systemd into Docker. They believe Docker should manage the life cycle of the container, and they do not want to accommodate users who want to run systemd in a container (This is [not true](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/) as of January 2024 - VR).\n",
    "\n",
    "The upstream Docker community believes the Docker daemon, as opposed to systemd, should be the controller of processes, it should manage the life cycle of containers, and it should start and stop them at boot time. The problem is there are many more features in systemd than in Docker, including startup ordering, socket activation, service ready notifications, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Podman was designed, the developers wanted to make sure it fully integrated with systemd. When you run systemd inside a container, Podman sets up the container the way systemd expects and allows it to simply run as PID1 of the container with limited privileges. Podman allows you to run services within the container the same way they run on a system or in a VM: via systemd unit files. Podman supports socket activation, service notifications, and many other systemd unit file features. Podman makes it simple to generate systemd unit files with best practices for running containers within a systemd service. For more information, see **chapter 7** on systemd integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Containers project](https://github.com/containers) where Podman, container libraries, and other container management tools reside, wants to embrace all features of the operating system and fully integrate it. Chapter 7 explains Podman integration with systemd."

This means that a non-root user can have multiple UIDs assigned to them within a container, allowing them to access resources and perform actions as if they were a different user, without requiring actual root privileges on the host system. This feature is a key aspect of how Podman provides containerization without relying on the root user, enhancing security and minimizing the risk of security vulnerabilities.\n",

    "Docker only supports running containers in a single, separate, user namespace, meaning all containers run within the same user namespace. Root in one container is the same as root in another container. It does not support running each container in a different user namespace, which means containers attack each other from a user-namespace perspective. Even though Docker supports this mode, almost no one runs containers with Docker in a separate user namespace (due to various reasons such as complexity and compatibility with existing systems - ChatGPT)."

Some containers want to bind to lower ports like port `80`, which is allowed inside the container, but `-p 80:80` fails, since `80` is less than `1024`. Using `-p 8080:80` causes Podman to bind the host’s port `8080` to port `80` within the container. The [upstream Podman repo](http://mng.bz/69ry) contains troubleshooting information on problems like binding to ports less than `1024` and many others.\n",

All of the Podman commands that interact with containers can use either the name or the ID.\n",

The stop signal tells the primary process within the container to exit gracefully. If the container doesn’t stop within `10` seconds, Podman sends the `SIGKILL` signal to the process, forcing the container to stop. The 10-second wait gives the processes in the container time to clean up and commit changes.\n",

The stop signal can be embedded in container images, as I describe in section 2.3.\n",

Most Podman commands that require you to specify a container name or ID also accept the `--latest` option. This is only available on Linux machines.\n",

      "       containers, images, volumes, network, pods.\n",
      "        So,  if  a container has the same name as an image, then the container\n",
      "       JSON will be returned, and so on.\n",

    "The `podman commit --squash` command is used to create a new image based on a container's changes and layers, while also collapsing all the layers into a single layer to reduce the size of the resulting image. When a container is running and changes are made inside it, multiple new layers are created to represent those changes. When you use the `podman commit` command without the `--squash` flag, all of these layers are kept, which can result in a larger and less efficient image.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `podman commit --squash` command, you can collapse all those layers into a single layer, making the resulting image smaller and more efficient. This can be useful for reducing the size of images before pushing them to a registry or sharing them with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to consider some potential drawbacks of using the `--squash` flag. By collapsing all the layers into a single layer, you lose the ability to inspect or revert to individual changes made in the container. This can make troubleshooting and debugging more difficult. Additionally, squash operations can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially for large containers with many layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, using the `podman commit --squash` command can be beneficial for reducing the size of images, especially for production use. However, it's important to weigh the trade-offs and consider whether the loss of individual layer information is acceptable for your specific use case."

    "In the container world, there is no more overused term than **container**. Often container refers to the running processes launched by Podman. But container can also refer to container data as the non-running objects sitting in container storage. As you saw in the previous section, `podman ps --all` shows running and non-running containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is the term **namespace**, which is used in many different ways. I often get confused when people talk about namespaces within Kubernetes. Some people hear the term and think of virtual clusters, but when I hear it I think of Linux namespaces used with Pods and Containers. Similarly, **image** can refer to a VM image, a container image, an OCI image, or a Docker image stored at a container registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think of **containers** as executing processes within an environment or something that is being prepared to run. In contrast, **images** are committed containers, which are prepared to be shared with others. Other users or systems can use these images to create new containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Container images** are just _committed_ containers. The OCI defines the format of an image. Podman uses the [containers/image library](https://github.com/containers/image) for all of its interaction with images. Container images can be stored in different types of storage or **transports**, as `container/image` refers to them. These transports can be **container registries**, Docker archives, OCI archives, docker-daemon, as well as `containers/storage`. See section 2.2.4 for more information on transports.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Podman, I usually refer to **images** as the content stored locally in a container storage or in container registries like `docker.io` and `quay.io`. Podman uses the GitHub [container/storage library](https://github.com/containers/storage) for handling locally stored images. Let’s take a closer look at it."

    "The `container/storage` library provides the concept of a **storage container**. Basically, storage containers are intermediate storage content that hasn’t been committed yet. Think of them as files on disk and some JSON describing the content. Podman has its own datastore of data related to a Podman container, and Podman needs to deal with multiple users of its containers at the same time. It relies on filesystem locking provided by `containers/storage` to make sure hundreds of Podman executables can reliably share the same datastore.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `container/storage` library manages three types of items: layers, images, and containers.\n",

    "A **layer** is a copy-on-write filesystem which is notionally stored as a set of changes relative to its parent layer, if it has one. A given layer can only have one parent, but any layer can be the parent of multiple layers. Layers which are parents of other layers should be treated as read-only.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **image** is a reference to a particular layer (its top layer), along with other information which the library can manage for the convenience of its caller. This information typically includes configuration templates for running a binary contained within the image's layers, and may include cryptographic signatures. Multiple images can reference the same layer, as the differences between two images may not be in their layer contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **container** is a read-write layer which is a child of an image's top layer, along with information which the library can manage for the convenience of its caller. This information typically includes configuration information for running the specific container. Multiple containers can be derived from a single image."

    "Now that you have a better understanding of containers and images, the next important step is updating your image. The main reasons for this are the need to update your application and the availability of new versions for the base image you use. You can build scripts to manually run the commands to build the image, but luckily, Podman optimized the experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you have been working with images, which were already created and uploaded to a container registry. The process of creating a container image is called **building**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building container images, you manage not only your application but also the image content used by this application. In the days prior to containers, you shipped applications as an RPM or DEB package, and then it was up to the distribution to make sure the other parts of the OS were kept up to date and secure. But in the container world, the container image includes the application along with a subset of the OS. \n",

    "Recall back in section 1.1.2 that [I described](#Container-image-format) a container image as a directory on disk that looks like root on a Linux system. This directory is called a **rootfs**. Several of the directives in a container job are adding content to this `rootfs`. This `rootfs` eventually contains all of the content used to create your container image.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every Containerfile must include a `FROM` line. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The `FROM` line specifies the image that the new image is based off, often called a **base image**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `podman build` command supports a special image named `scratch`, which means to start your image with no content. When Podman sees the `FROM scratch` directive, it just allocates space in containers/storage for an empty `rootfs`, then `COPY` can be used to populate the `rootfs`. More often, the `FROM` directive uses an existing image. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8` causes Podman to pull the `ubi8` image from the `registry.access.redhat.com` container registry and copy it to container storage. `podman build` pulls the same image as the `podman pull` command you learned about in [section 2.2.8](#podman-pull-|-Pulling-images). When the image is pulled, Podman uses container storage to mount the image on the `rootfs` directory, using a copy on the write filesystem, like OverlayFS, where the other directives can start to add content. This image becomes the **base layer** of the `rootfs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `COPY` directive is often used to copy files, directories, or tarballs off of the local host into the newly created `rootfs`. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `RUN` directive is one of the most commonly used Containerfile directives. \n",
    "\n",
    "`RUN` tells Podman to actually run a container on the image. Package management tools, like DNF/YUM and apt-get, are run to install packages from distributions onto your new image. The `RUN` directive runs any command within the container image as a container. The `podman build` command runs the commands with the same security constraints as the `podman run` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, imagine you want to add the `ps` command to a container image; you can create a directive like the following. The `RUN` command executes a container, which updates all of the packages from the base image, and then installs the `procps-ns` package, which includes the `ps` command. Finally the containerized command executes `yum` to clean up after itself, so `cruft` is removed from the container image:\n",

    "`ENTRYPOINT “/bin/sh -c”`|Allows you to configure a container to run as an executable. The `ENTRYPOINT` instruction is not overwritten when arguments are passed to `podman run`. This allows arguments to be passed to the entrypoint — for instance, `podman run <image> -d` passes the `-d` argument to the `ENTRYPOINT`.\n",

As I described in **chapter 1**, the only thing required to be shared with traditional containers is the Linux kernel. There are several reasons you need to isolate application data from the application, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoiding embedding actual data for applications such as databases.\n",
    "- Using the same container image to run multiple environments.\n",
    "- Reducing overhead and improving storage read/write performance, since volumes write directly to the filesystem, while containers use the **overlay** or **fuse-overlayfs** filesystem to mount their layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Overlay** is a layered filesystem, meaning the kernel needs to copy the previous layer entirely to create a new layer, and **fuse-overlayfs** switches each read and write from kernel space to user space and back. All of this creates quite an overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sharing content available via network storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: `bind` mounts remount parts of the file hierarchy in a different location on the filesystem. The files and directories in the `bind mount` are the same as the original (see the `mount` command man page for an explanation of bind mounts). A `bind mount` allows the same content to be accessible in two places, without any additional overhead. It is important to understand that `bind` does not copy the data or create new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supporting volumes also adds complexity, especially concerning security. A lot of the security features of containers prevent the container processes from gaining access to the filesystem outside the container image. In this chapter, you will discover the ways Podman allows you to work around these obstacles."

      "\n",
      "       This tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on device (which\n",

      "       \"Non-superuser mounts\" below for more details. The previous contents\n",
